                Fullbody split means to work all of the muscle group in one workout.
                You need to do the workout 2-3 times a week, with at least one day of rest/active recovery between workout days.
                Usually, the workout is sorted by the size of the muscle group. For example: Legs first, Chest second, Back third, etc. 
                The "Fullbody" is considered good for beginners because it's easy to persist with it due to the low number of workouts a week. 
                The main reason most people should do full-body workouts over split workouts is time. 
                Most people don't have enough time to dedicate an hour a day to exercising in the first place, let alone spend that much time on a single muscle group.  
                Full-body workouts maximize your time, and instead of spending your one hour (or less) pumping up your biceps, you could be chasing real gains like whole-body strength, core stabilization, functional mobility and endurance.

                Most of the workout is built from compound exercises (Exercises that involve a lot of muscles). 
                Those exercises, while training functional strength, Are also training the cardiovascular system, 
                And by doing that, it helps us to burn fat.
