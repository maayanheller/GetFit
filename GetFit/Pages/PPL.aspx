                A "PPL" split means to split your body into 3 parts:
            </p>
            <ol>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>P</strong>ush muscles - Chest, Triceps, and Shoulders.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>P</strong>ull muscles - Back and Biceps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>L</strong>egs and lower body muscles - Hamstring, Quads, Glutes, Abdominals, and Calves.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <p>
                Based on each part of the split, you build a workout that is focused on the body parts included in it. <br />
                During the week you can schedule you'r workout in several ways: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>6 Days -</strong> You have one rest day, for instance saturday. The workouts are alternated through the week, and you can can't have the same workout 2 days in a row. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>5 Days -</strong> You have 2 rest days, for instance wednesday and saturday. In the first half of the week you can have all of the workouts, and in the second half skip on one of them, or vice versa.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>3 Days -</strong> You have every workout one a week. This distribution isn't effective because you train each muscle only once a week.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The "PPL" split is probably the most efficient workout split there is because all related muscle groups are trained together in the same workout. <br />
                This means that you get the maximum overlap of movements within the same workout, and the muscle groups being trained get an overall benefit from this overlap.
            </p>
            <h3>
                PPL Pros
            </h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Among the most notable benefits of the Push Pull Legs split is that it allows us to ‘bundle’ muscle groups that typically work together. <br />
                    For example, the biceps contribute to pulling movements, and training both muscle groups in the same workout is an efficient way to cause a stimulus.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The Push Pull Legs split works for lifters of all levels, and you can use it to make great progress for many years. <br /> 
                    For example, as you first start training, you can follow the 3-day split. Then, as you advance, you can jump on a 4-day a week frequency and eventually work up to training six days per week. <br /> 
                    No matter what your goals and fitness level are, you can make it work.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Because we bundle muscle groups that work well together, we effectively prevent overlap, and the risk of training muscle groups in a fatigued state is much lower. <br />
                    For example, if you train your chest, shoulders, and triceps on Monday, you will have several days to recover before you have to train them again, no matter what training frequency you follow.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                PPL Cons
            </h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Focusing on every muscle group can be quite challenging. For example, if you start your push workouts with chest training, your triceps and shoulders will have to come in as second and third. <br />
                    Because of that, it might be a good idea to alternate the movement you start your workouts with. 
                    If you begin one workout with a chest exercise, you may want to start the next one with a shoulder movement.
                </li>

                <li>
                    It’s challenging to establish a consistent training schedule with the Push Pull Legs split if you want to train four or five times per week. 
                    For example, training three and six days per week allows you to have a consistent schedule. 
                    Having a workout tracker with a built-in calendar like Hevy will definitely help. 
                    But, if you want to train four or five days per week (as many intermediates do), your plan will change from week to week.
