        About
    </h1>
    <p>
        I chose the website theme because of my high interest in the field of weight lifting. <br />
        When I started with weight lifting, I didn't have lots of info about building a routine and what should I do while I am in the gym. <br />
        Workout splits are the way you divide your muscles over a number of workouts a week, for example: Sunday - Triceps and Chest, Monday - Back and biceps, etc. <br />
        This website contains the most popular splits, and their pros/cons, with images of exercise suggestions, famous athletes and article-linked<br />
