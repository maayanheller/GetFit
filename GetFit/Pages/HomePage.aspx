            A workout split is simply a way of dividing your training sessions into different body regions.
            Workout splits are typically used in weight lifting but they can be used in bodyweight training too. There is no ‘one size fits all’ for the best workout split.
            Your training split depends on your goals, your training age, your schedule and how much time you want to be spending in the gym.

            Focusing on the legs and butt in one session and arms, back, and chest in another session is common. Abdominal training can fit in either session.
            There are many possibole combinations in the world of weight lifting (also in bodyweight training), but int these blog has the most popular amongst them.

            Split system training is mostly used by bodybuilders or fitness trainers; professional powerlifters and Olympic lifters do not use this approach.
